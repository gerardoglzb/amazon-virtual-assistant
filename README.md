<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](http://amazon-va.herokuapp.com/)

A simple web app where a user can add Amazon products through their urls and have them all displayed on their personal board. Alongside each product, they're able to specify a price they're looking for, and whenever a product drops below said price, the app will also notify the user through their email.

This project was created for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TechWithTim/videos">Tech With Tim</a>'s Timathon.
It's worth noting that the website won't actually notify you since I didn't want to pay $21 for a third dyno on heroku.

### Built With

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your own local copy up and running.

### Prerequisites

* pip

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gerardoglzb/amazon-virtual-assistant.git
```

2. Install python packages

* Packages in requirements.txt file
```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up the environment variables

* EMAIL_USER
The email account you want to use to send notifications (it must be a Gmail account, unless you modify it).

* EMAIL_PASSWORD
The password to your email account.

* SECRET_KEY
A secret key for your server.

* DATABASE_URL
Url for your PostgreSQL database.

* REDISTOGO_URL
Url for your redis server.

* DEBUG_VALUE
"True" if you want to activate debug mode.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

You can run the project like this:

```sh
python3 run.py
```

Make sure to also start your redis server like this:

```sh
redis-server
```

And run the worker:
```sh
python3 worker.py
```

And finally, the clock:
```sh
python3 clock.py
```

These four must be running simultaneously.

And that's it! You have your own local copy of the Amazon Virtual Assistant. You can try this out by accessing your localhost:5000 on your browser.

You can host this on a site like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). However, the way it's set right now, using Heroku would require three dynos (at least $21).
